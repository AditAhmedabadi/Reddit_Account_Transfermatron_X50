REDDIT ACCOUNT TRANFERMATRON X50

This is a program to import all the user's subscribed subreddits to a new reddit account as reddit doesnt let u change your username.

After sometime u find your username too cringey so i made this program to subscribe to all previously subscribed subreddits automatically because its time consuming to do it all over again.

Requirements:

You must have both reddit accounts on developer mode and you have to provide Client_ID and secret_id to the program
How To:
First Make a new account, set the new username you finally wanted.
After You Login go to "https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/" and create an app
U can put anything where it asks u for URI
Do this on the old account as well
Set use to personal use script
Now the Client ID is the one below You APPs name
secret is your secret id
Run the program enter following details
If you want to add more subreddits you could..the program asks for it later
Enjoy Your New account with a non cringey username
